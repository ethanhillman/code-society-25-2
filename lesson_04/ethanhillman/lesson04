#python
def is_even(number):
    return number % 2 == 0

print(is_even(6))  # Output: True
print(is_even(9))  # Output: False

#javascript
# function isEven(number) {
#     return number % 2 === 0;
# }
# console.log(isEven(6));  # Output: true
# console.log(isEven(9));  # Output: false


##Explanation

In Python, the logic expressed as return number % 2 == 0, which evaluates to true or false.
In JavaScript, the same idea is written as return number % 2 ===0, which evaluates to true or false.
The main difference lies in the syntax Python uses def to define functions and print() to display results, 
while JavaScript uses the function keyword and console.log() to output results. When tested with the numbers 
6 and 9, both versions correctly identify 6 as even and 9 as odd, demonstrating that although the syntax differs
between the 2 languages, the underlying logic is exactly the same.
